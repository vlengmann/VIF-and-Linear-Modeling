# VIF-and-Linear-Modeling
Exploring how VIF values contribute to a linear model in Car Dekho dataset

---

## Purpose
The purpose of this report is to explore the resale values of used vehicles in the pre-owned car market using the Car Dekho dataset. The analysis focuses on identifying key attributes influencing resale values and assessing the presence of multicollinearity among the predictive factors

---

## Workflow
The workflow is as follows:

1. Read in dataset
2. Analyze numerical and categorical variables
3. Analyze bivariate relationships 
4. Run the linear model
4. Drop variables to reduce VIF scores and rerun model to analyze model efficiency
5. Diagnostic plots to check linear assumptions about data
